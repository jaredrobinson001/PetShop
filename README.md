Pet Shop is an e-commerce application for Android built with Flutter (iOS to come soon). The goal is to implement the Flutter framework for large scale Andriod and iOS applications, implementing native platform features like camera, location, biometrics and NFC. However, only authentication and a couple database(using Firebase) reads and writes have been fully implemented. I also hope to integrate biometrics, location reading, payment etc

## Design

- Provider architecture
- FirebaseAuth for authentication
- Firebase Cloud Firestore as backend database
- Fetched store images from Amazon

## Building

1. Clone the repo to your local computer
2. Make sure you have Flutter and firebase installed

Please, remember to use a rule that allows unauthenticated reads.

3. Add the app to the Firebase project and save google-services.json to PROJECT/app folder
4. Open and run the the project with VS Code or Android Studio 3.x
